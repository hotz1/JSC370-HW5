This repo stores the information and pages for the GitHub.io Website which I created for JSC370 Homework Assignment 5.

This website includes interactive data visualizations for Spotify Charts data collected during the first three months of 2022, as well as data collected from the 2021 edition of the World Happiness Report.

The website is located at https://hotz1.github.io/Spotify-Charts-Data-Site/index.html.
